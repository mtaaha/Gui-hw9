Description:In this webpage, I have implemented a single line scrabble board. The user can drag tiles from the rack to
single link board. When the user inserts it in the double tiles, it doubles the score. The score is updated as the user
drags the tiles from the rack onto the board. There is also a reset button that resets all the rack tiles in case the user
is stuck. The user can press the reset button multiplie times and it will reset the rack and board. If the user tries to
drag the tile of the board, the tile will just back to the rack.
